[Mastering
Bitcoin](http://chimera.labs.oreilly.com/books/1234000001802/index.html) is a
good book to completely understand bitcoin. It's not super technical, but it's
a good start to learning about bitcoin. It's excellent, especially if supplemented with other
articles and papers on the more technical aspects.
