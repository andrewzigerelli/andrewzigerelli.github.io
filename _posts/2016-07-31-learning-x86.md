title: Learning x86.

I'm going to be reading *Assembly Language for x86 Processors* by **Kip
Irvine**.

Why would I want to learn x86? I have a few goals:

* I want to be able to read x86 when it's necessary. Sometimes the code
  generated from compiling isn't what you expect. It
  would be easier to tell the difference if you could read the generated
  assembly.
* I want to learn a CISC architecture. I know some MIPS. I could learn ARM, but
  why not try a different instruction style?
* I want to move closer to the hardware. High level is nice, but I'm really
  interested in what actually goes on with the processor.

I hope this is fun!
