# About
I am a PhD student in the ECE department at the University of Pittsburgh.

Here is an incomplete list of academic topics I like:
math, computer science, computer and electrical engineering

This website serves, in part, as a project to learn
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which allows one to blog using plaintext and
markdown. It's even supported by github pages! Check jekyll out if you have a
static site; it's an extremely cool project.
