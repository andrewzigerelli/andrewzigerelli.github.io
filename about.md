# About
I am a PhD student in the ECE department at the University of Pittsburgh.

I'm currently advised by [Jun Yang](http://www.pitt.edu/~juy9/) and [Youtao
Zhang](http://people.cs.pitt.edu/~zhangyt/). 

This website serves, in part, as a project to learn
[Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), which enables one to blog using plaintext and
markdown.
