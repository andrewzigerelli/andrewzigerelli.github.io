# About
I **was* in a PhD program at the University of Pittsburgh in Electrical and
Computer Engineering. In January 2021, I decided to leave the program. 

****I'm currently on the job market****.** 

I focused on GPUs in the beginning, but switched to security. I focused mainly
on hardware side channels. I like cryptography.
