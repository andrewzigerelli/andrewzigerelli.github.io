Work Experience

June 2015 – February 2016

    RESEARCH ASSISTANT, DREXEL UNIVERSITY, DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS

    Performed scientific programming. At Drexel, under Dr. Thomas Yu,
    implemented the software to model membranes and moved calculations
    from CPU to GPU. This modelling involved geometric computation and
    solving the resulting optimization problem. The optimization problem
    is described here.

    Implemented code for non-linear optimization problems in biophysics
    utilizing SNOPT (Sparse Nonlinear OPTimizer)

    _Languages/Software Used_: C++, C, CUDA, Matlab, SNOPT

June 2014 - January 2015

    RESEARCH ASSISTANT, PITTSBURGH SUPERCOMPUTING CENTER

    Helped to modify a computational physics package which calculated
    electronic structures for different materials.

    Assisted Dr. Yang Wang, a research physicist at the Pittsburgh
    Supercomputing Center, who has a large software package used for
    materials engineering. This involved a heavy computation in quantum
    mechanics. It is described here.

    Assisted in translating code from Fortran to C, and then move some
    of the computation from CPU to GPU using CUDA.

    Worked to speed up software so that solid state physicists could get
    results more quickly, as computation may take days, even on modern
    supercomputers.

    _Languages/Software used_: C, C++, CUDA, Fortran

April 2012 – September 2013

    RESEARCH ASSISTANT, DREXEL UNIVERSITY, DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS

    Developed a software package to model biological membranes in
    varying physical conditions.

    Awarded Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship for this work.

    Other duties similar to Drexel Research Assistant position
    description above.

    _Languages/Software used_: C++, C, Matlab

April 2011 - September 2013

    TUTOR, DREXEL UNIVERSITY, DEPARTMENT OF MATHEMATICS

    Tutored undergraduate math classes daily for small groups of
    students and individuals.
