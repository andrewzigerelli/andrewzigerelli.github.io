Work Experience
--------------------

June 2015 – February 2016

:   **Research Assistant, Drexel University, Department of Mathematics**

    Performed scientific programming.  At Drexel, under Dr. Thomas Yu, implemented
    the software to model membranes and moved calculations from CPU to GPU.  This
    modelling involved geometric computation and solving the resulting optimization problem.  The
    optimization problem is described [here](http://andrewzigerelli.com/projects/sub_bio.pdf).

    Implemented code for non-linear optimization problems in biophysics utilizing
    SNOPT (Sparse Nonlinear OPTimizer)

    *Languages/Software Used*: C++, C, CUDA, Matlab, SNOPT 

June 2014 - January 2015

:    **Research Assistant, Pittsburgh Supercomputing Center**
    
    Helped to modify a computational physics package which calculated electronic
    structures for different materials.  

    Assisted Dr. Yang Wang, a research physicist at the Pittsburgh Supercomputing
    Center, who has a large software package used for materials engineering.  This
    involved a heavy computation in quantum mechanics. 
    It is described [here](http://andrewzigerelli.com/projects/mst.pdf).

    Assisted in translating code from Fortran to C, and then move some of the
    computation from CPU to GPU using CUDA.

    Worked to speed up software so that solid state physicists could get results
    more quickly, as computation may take days, even on modern supercomputers.

    *Languages/Software used*: C, C++, CUDA, Fortran

April 2012 – September 2013 
:   **Research Assistant, Drexel University, Department of Mathematics**

    Developed a software package to model biological membranes in varying physical
    conditions.  

    Awarded Barry M. Goldwater Scholarship for this work.

    Other duties similar to Drexel Research Assistant position description above.

    *Languages/Software used*: C++, C, Matlab

April 2011 - September 2013

:   **Tutor, Drexel University, Department of Mathematics**

    Tutored undergraduate math classes daily for small groups of students and
    individuals.
